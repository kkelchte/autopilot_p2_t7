My LSTM Autopilot

Folder content:

projectfiles:
> pilot_CNN: extract features of pretrained CNN (inception) saved as pb-txt-pbtxt file.
> pilot_data_prepare: aid functions for preparing the data in pilot_data.
> pilot_data: obtain and prepare features of all data object movies and fully preload the data
> pilot_eval: evaluate a model (checkpoint: .ckpt) by unrolling 1 step
> pilot_extract: Extract the finetuned inception v3 features of pilot data.
> pilot_model: Build the pilot LSTM network, later add CNN layers here
> pilot_read: Read and preprocess the RGB images of the data set.
> pilot_settings: groupings all the hyperparameters of the networks trained.
> pilot_states: creating image with overview of inner states.
> pilot_train: Main script for training the LSTM model on features.

extra:
> tmp_scripts: temporal scripts used for preparing data, running jobs, cleaning results, ...
> *.pyc: bytecodes
> __init__.py: file claiming this folder as a package
